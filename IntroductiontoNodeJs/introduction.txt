Introduction to Node.js

• Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that enables developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser.

• It runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser.

• Node.js operates in a single-threaded process and uses an event-driven, non-blocking architecture, making it ideal for handling concurrent requests efficiently.

• It allows developers to use JavaScript for both frontend and backend development, making the development process faster and easier.

• Key Features of Node.js---

- High Performance: Uses the V8 engine for fast execution.
- Scalability: Handles many simultaneous connections, making it suitable for real-time applications.
- Unified Language: JavaScript is used both on the client-side and server-side.
- Large Ecosystem: npm (Node Package Manager) provides access to thousands of pre-built modules.

• Use Cases of Node.js---

- Web Servers: Fast, scalable web servers.
- APIs: Lightweight RESTful APIs.
- Real-Time Applications: Chat apps, notifications, multiplayer games.
- IoT: Handles multiple requests for IoT applications.

• Core Technologies---

- Event-Driven Architecture: Uses an event loop to handle multiple requests simultaneously without new threads.
- libuv: Library enabling asynchronous I/O operations for efficient concurrency.

• Node.js Frameworks & Libraries---

- Express.js: A lightweight framework for web applications and APIs.
- Socket.io: Library for real-time communication.
- Mongoose: A library for interacting with MongoDB.
- PM2: A process manager for keeping Node.js applications running.

• Latest JavaScript Engines Used by Web Browsers (2025)---

1. Google Chrome: Uses the 'V8 JavaScript engine'.
2. Mozilla Firefox: Uses 'SpiderMonkey' as the JavaScript engine.
3. Apple Safari: Uses 'JavaScriptCore' (also known as Nitro).
4. Microsoft Edge: After switching to Chromium in 2020, Edge now uses the 'V8 engine'

• Important Concepts---

1) How Does Node.js Work?
- Node.js runs on a single-threaded non-blocking event loop model, enabling it to handle many requests without blocking operations.

2) Advantages of Node.js
- High performance due to the V8 engine.
- Ideal for real-time applications (e.g., chat apps, notifications).
- Great for microservices architecture.
- npm ecosystem accelerates development.

3) Disadvantages of Node.js
- Not suitable for CPU-intensive tasks (e.g., video processing).
- Callback Hell: Complex nested callbacks, but can be avoided using Promises/async-await.

4) Why is Node.js Important?
- Real-Time Communication: Ideal for applications like chat and live-streaming.
- Full-Stack Development: JavaScript for both frontend and backend.
- Microservices: Supports scalable and independent services.

5) How Does Node.js Handle Concurrency?
- Node.js uses a non-blocking, event-driven architecture.
- This means it can handle multiple requests without waiting for one to complete before starting the next.
- It uses a single thread to manage all requests but delegates I/O operations to the system, allowing for efficient parallel processing.

6) When and by whom was Node.js invented, and what key technologies were used in its creation?
- Node.js was invented in 2009 by Ryan Dahl.
- It was first released in May 2009.
- Ryan Dahl created it to address the need for a platform capable of handling many simultaneous connections efficiently, especially for real-time applications.
- He combined the V8 JavaScript engine with a non-blocking, event-driven architecture and used C++ for performance optimizations.
- This made Node.js fast and scalable for building server-side applications using JavaScript.

7) What is the difference between client-side and server-side in web development?
- Client-side: The part of a web application that runs on the user's browser, responsible for rendering the interface and handling user interactions.
- Server-side: The part of a web application that runs on the web server, responsible for processing requests, managing data, and sending responses to the client.

8) What is API?
- An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other by sending requests and receiving responses to exchange data and functionality.

Example:- Imagine a waiter in a restaurant as an API:
- The customer (user) gives a request (order) to the waiter (API).
- The waiter takes the order and goes to the kitchen (server).
- The kitchen prepares the food (data or functionality) and sends it back to the waiter (API).
- The waiter then delivers the response (food) to the customer (user).

9) What is the role of npm?
- npm is used to manage and install packages, speeding up development by providing ready-to-use libraries.
